# Voice Call Feature Guide

## 🎙️ What's Fixed

The voice call feature has been completely refactored to work properly with audio-only calls. Previously, the component was trying to display video elements even for audio calls, causing issues.

### Key Changes:

1. **Separate Audio/Video UI**
   - Audio calls now show an avatar with animated pulse effect
   - Video calls show actual video streams
   - Proper conditional rendering based on `callType`

2. **Dedicated Audio Element**
   - Created separate `remoteAudioRef` for audio calls
   - Audio element is hidden but properly plays remote audio
   - Video element only used for video calls

3. **Enhanced Audio Logging**
   - Added 🎙️ emoji logs for audio-specific events
   - Tracks audio stream connection and playback
   - Easy to debug audio issues

4. **Smart Stream Handling**
   - `useEffect` automatically routes stream to correct element (audio/video)
   - `ontrack` handler properly attaches streams based on call type
   - Automatic retry logic for autoplay failures
